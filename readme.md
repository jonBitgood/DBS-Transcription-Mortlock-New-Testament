# Mortlock New Testament
### Transcription Project

## Synopsis

There are a number of Biblical texts that were created before a digital medium existed. This project is to edit the OCR scan of those texts for accuracy and to convert it to the .usfm standard.

Manually going over the full text and checking every word.
The USFM markup will be added once the text has been checked and compared to the scans of the original version.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Digital Bible Society transcription project. We are building a [web interface](http://dbs.org/bibles/transcriptions/). for proofreading these texts. If you prefer to work offline just let us know what book you are working on so that there’s no duplicate effort.

## License

All the Bibles that we are scanning and editing are in the public domain. If you are going to use the finished project. We’d be very grateful if you link to this project or our website. http://dbs.org/
